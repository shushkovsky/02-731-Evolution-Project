1. pembertonEtAl2013.MS5795.stru

This file includes the exact microsatellite data used by Pemberton et al.
(2013) in their human-only analyses.  The format that is used by the STRUCTURE
program.  The first line gives the list of loci. After the first line, each
individual is listed on two consecutive lines.  The first five columns include
the following information:

(1) Individual code number assigned by the source publication (HGDP-CEPH,
	Native American, Latino, Jewish, Asian Indian, and Chha Gaam Patel
	individuals) or adjusted by a fixed amount from that of the source
	publication; we added 2000 to all individual IDs from the Pacific
	Islander data set, and we added 70000 to all individual IDs from the
	African data set.
(2) Population code number assigned by the source publication (HGDP-CEPH,
	Native American, Latino, Jewish, Asian Indian, and Chha Gaam Patel 
	populations) or adjusted by a fixed amount from that of the source
	publication; we added 1000 to all population IDs from the Pacific
	Islander data set, and we added 1100 to all population IDs from the
	African data set.
(3) Population name.
(4) Location.
(5) Pre-defined geographic region affiliation, as was used in the article.

The next columns contain genotypes (measured in base pairs).  The left-to-right
order of the genotypes corresponds to the left-to-right order of the locus names
on the first line of the file.  The placement of genotypes on the first versus
second line for an individual is arbitrary.  Missing data is denoted by "-9".

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. pembertonEtAl2013.MS5795.loci

This file contains information on the 645 microsatellite markers included in the
combined human data set in file #1.

The first five columns include the following information:

(1) Chromosome
(2) Marshfield screening set
(3) Locus name (as given in row 1 of file #1)
(4) Size of repeat unit.
(5) Physical map position (bp; NCBI Build 36)
(6) Genetic map position (cM; Rutgers Combined Physical-Linkage Map)

Physical map positions were taken from "Sequence determinants of human
microsatellite variability" by TJ Pemberton, CI Sandefur, M Jakobsson, NA
Rosenberg (BMC Genomics 10:612 [2009]).  Genetic map positions were interpolated
onto the Rutgers Combined Linkage-Physical Map from the physical map positions
in column 5. For some loci, it was not possible to determine a physical map
position or interpolate their genetic map position; these are denoted by "*".

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. pembertonEtAl2013.M5879.stru

This file includes the exact data used by Pemberton et al. (2013) in their
combined human-chimpanzee analyses.  The format is that used by the structure
program (see #1 above).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. pembertonEtAl2013.M5879.loci

This file contains information on the 246 microsatellite markers included in the
combined human-chimpanzee data set in file #3.  The format is the same as file #2
above.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. pembertonEtAl2013.subsets.txt

This file includes the source data set and subset membership information for
the individuals included in files #1 and #3.  The first five columns are as
described in #1 above.  In the next columns "1" indicates the inclusion of an
individual in that set and "0" indicates exclusion, with the exception of the
"fromChhaGaamPatel-dataSet[pembertonEtAl2012]?" column.  In this column, "0"
indicates exclusion, and a letter representing the village of origin of the
individual indicates inclusion: B, Bhadran; D, Dharmaj; K, Karamsad; N, Nadiad;
S, Sojitra; V, Vaso; O, non-Chha Gaam Patel village.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. pembertonEtAl2013.codes.txt

This file contains code numbers that have been assigned to the populations in
files associated with the Pemberton et al. (2013) paper.  The columns include
the following information:

(1) Population code number assigned by the source publication (HGDP-CEPH,
	Native American, Latino, Jewish, Asian Indian, and Chha Gaam Patel 
	populations) or adjusted by a fixed amount from that of the source
	publication (Pacific Islander and African data set populations).
(2) Population name.
(3) Location.
(4) Pre-defined geographic region affiliation, as was used in the article.
(5) Data set of origin

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. pembertonEtAl2013.coordinates.txt

This file contains the exact geographic coordinates for populations provided
in Table S20 of the Pemberton et al. (2013) paper.  The first five columns are
as described for file #6 above; columns 6 and 7 include the following
information:

(6) Latitude [degrees north]
(7) Longitude [degrees east]

For some populations, geographic coordinates were not available; these are
denoted by "NA".
